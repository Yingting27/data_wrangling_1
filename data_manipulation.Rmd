Import FAS litters and pups

```{r}
litters_df=
  read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

pups_df=
  read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```




## `select`

`select` is used to select colunms!

```{r}
select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)
#this select function can get colunms in one data

select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth)

#when you want to select mutiply columns, you can use ":" to choose several columns, for example, from gd0_weight to gd_of_birth, and everything between these two columns are selected

select(litters_df, group, starts_with("pups"))
#keep all columns that start with some words, you can select all colums that start with pups using starts_with function

select(litters_df, -litter_number)

select(litters_df, -starts_with("gd"))

#when using "-", you can subtract the columns that with -, like delete litter_number column, and those columns that start with gd

select(litters_df, group, litter_id = litter_number)
#this would rename columns, just use a new variable to be a variable, and this would only show this columns

select(litters_df, group,litter_id = litter_number, everything())
#based on the situation above, if you want to keep everything else in the data, you can add everything function

select(litters_df, gd0_weight, everything())
# I want gd0_weight (i want this to be the first column) and keep the other things that comes from after this
```


`select` vs `pull`

```{r}
select(litters_df, group)
pull(litters_df, group)

#select: put a data frame in, get a data frame out
# pull: like break tidyverse logic by extracting a column from a data frame, and showing like a vector floating around, it doesn't exist inside of a data frame anyone

# if you want to get something out of data or table, you can use pull.
```
```{r}
rename(litters_df, litter_id = litter_number)
#have the same effect that rename columns and then keep anything else

relocate(litters_df, litter_number)
#this function would bring litter_number first, and keep anything else
```

## learning assessment
```{r}
pups_df=
  read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_df = janitor::clean_names(pups_df)

select(pups_df, litter_number, sex, pd_ears)
```
